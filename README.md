**A Novel Robot-Material System for Parallel Construction**

This repository contains the Grasshopper implementation of an **assembly algorithm integrating agent-based modeling with A* pathfinding** developed as part of the *Awakened Structures* thesis project.

The thesis research explores how shape-changing materials and mobile robots can collaborate in a co-designed framework to enable efficient, decentralized construction. The project features a modular system of deployable building block and a custom robotic assembler, coordinated through a mesh-based agent system.
